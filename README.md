# OSN-2024

Slides and examples from my 2024 Open Source North Presentation on [Empowering Engineering Teams with Large Langage Models : From Ideation to Implementation ](https://www.opensourcenorth.com/presentation/empowering-engineering-teams-with-large-language-models-from-ideation-to-implementation/)

This presentation explores innovative applications of LLMs across the engineering lifecycle, from ideation and design to implementation and testing. We’ll showcase practical examples, including automated requirements gathering, design optimization, code generation, and model testing, highlighting how LLMs can streamline processes, enhance team productivity, and drive project success. Join us to learn how anyone can harness the power of LLMs to tackle complex challenges, improve decision-making, and lead teams to deliver high-quality engineering projects efficiently.
